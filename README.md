# Campaign Management System

## Overview
A sophisticated campaign management system that leverages AI to provide intelligent campaign suggestions and management capabilities. The system integrates with MongoDB for data persistence and uses advanced AI services for campaign optimization.

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Campaign Suggestions**: Integration with Cerebras API for intelligent campaign recommendations
- **Robust Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication system
- **Ad Banner Upload**: Supports both URL and file upload options
- **Audience Targeting**: Age range, locations, and interests selection
- **Campaign Management**: Create and view campaigns with all details
- **AI-Powered Features**: Ad copy suggestions generated dynamically
- **Simulated Analytics**: Fake impressions, CTR, and spend data
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Campaign Status Control**: Activate, deactivate, and delete campaigns
- **Image Management**: GridFS storage for banner images
- **User Registration & Login**: Complete authentication flow
- **Campaign Editing**: Modify existing campaigns
- **Asynchronous Architecture**: Efficient handling of database operations and API calls
- **MongoDB Integration**: Scalable data storage with proper async/await patterns
